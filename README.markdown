# CEH Information Gateway - Vagrant Box

This is the CEH development box, it will create an instance of the CEH Catalogue along with it's supporting services (e.g. solr, mapserver)

## Structure

Inside the vagrant box there are a few git repositories which are checked out. 

### /opt/ceh-catalogue -> ssh://git@stash.ceh.ac.uk:7999/cig/catalogue.git

  A dump of the software repository, this contains things like the templates for the 
  content generated by the web application.

### /etc/ceh-catalogue -> ssh://git@stash.ceh.ac.uk:7999/cig/catalogue-config.git

  This directory contains all of the configuration options for all of the environments.

  It is the development.properties which is relevant for the vagrant box.

### /var/ceh-catalogue/datastore -> ssh://git@stash.ceh.ac.uk:7999/cig/tcExport.git

  This contains a dump of test data for the vagrant box to use.
