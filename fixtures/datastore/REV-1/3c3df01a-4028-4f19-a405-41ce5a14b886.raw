Predictors are climatic (minimum January temperature, maximum July temperature, annual precipitation) or based on community traits (height and three Ellenberg scores). The models are fit with up to 5 techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forests and neural networks) and both individual and ensemble outputs produced.","metadataDate":"2019-11-06T15:33:59","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/3c3df01a-4028-4f19-a405-41ce5a14b886"}],"keywords":[{"value":"Niche"},{"value":"Species distribution"},{"value":"Vegetation"}],"primaryPurpose":"Predict occurrence of plant species in relation to environmental change","licenseType":"open","modelType":"Stochastic","currentModelVersion":"2.1.1","spatialDomain":"Parameterised for GB only","spatialResolution":"4 m2","language":"R","releaseDate":"2016-12-05","inputVariables":[{"title":"Maximum July temperature (degrees C)","type":"number"},{"title":"Minimum January temperature (degrees C)","type":"number"},{"title":"Annual precipitation (mm)","type":"number"},{"title":"Grime height score","type":"number"},{"title":"Ellenberg F","type":"number"},{"title":"Ellenberg N","type":"number"},{"title":"Ellenberg R","type":"number"}],"outputVariables":[{"title":"Probability of occurrence"}],"onlineResources":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.5285/94ae1a5a-2a28-4315-8d4b-35ae964fc3b9","function":"documentation"},{"url":"https://github.com/NERC-CEH/multimove","function":"code"}],"references":[{"citation":"Niche models for British plants and lichens obtained using an ensemble approach P.
