The pollen diets of bees were quantified using a teaspoon and some sellotape. The purpose of the study was to provide valuable information to scientists, governments and land managers in designing effective measures to establish bee communities on Mars\n\nThe work was funded by NASA's \"Bees of Tomorrow on Mars\" (BOTOM) programme.\n","metadataDate":"2020-01-08T14:49:34","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/c88921ba-f871-44c3-9339-51c5bee4024a"},{"code":"10.5285/5b338064-b09b-4846-a0b3-b7ec358e5e1e","codeSpace":"doi:"}],"lineage":"Study area:\nMy garden\n\nBee surveys:\nBees were identified to species level.
