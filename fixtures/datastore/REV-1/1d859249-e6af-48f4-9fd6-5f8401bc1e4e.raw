Radioecology is the study of the behaviour and effects of radioactive elements in the environment and measures exposure to radiation of humans and other organisms. \nThe consortium members are:  IRSN (France), STUK (Finland), SCK.CEN (Belgium), NERC-CEH (UK), Ciemat (Spain), Stockholm University (Sweden), NRPA (Norway), University of Life Sciences (Norway) and BfS (Germany).  A key focus of the NoE is the promotion of collaboration and long-term integration to maintain European radioecological expertise including the development of training and education programmes/materials and knowledge exchange mechanisms. The NoE also has scientific workpackages considering: integrated human and non-human radiation protection; radiation protection in a mixed contaminant context and; ecological relevant low dose effects.\nSTAR is committed to making all of the data generated during the course of its science activities openly available. STAR members are also collating their existing data holdings and identifying priority datasets to make freely available. Some of the datasets are being made available through the Information Gateway, either directly or via metadata records which contain contact information to request specific datasets.\nThis is a series record which lists the various entries of the STAR partners on the Information Gateway. \nDetails of the STAR project can be found on www.star-radioecology.org.","metadataDate":"2018-01-18T14:05:11","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/1d859249-e6af-48f4-9fd6-5f8401bc1e4e","coupledResource":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/1d859249-e6af-48f4-9fd6-5f8401bc1e4e"}],"lineage":"Not applicable","metadataStandardName":"ISO19115","metadataStandardVersion":"2003/Cor.1:2006","datasetLanguages":["eng"],"topicCategories":[{"value":"environment","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/environment"}],"distributionFormats":[{"name":"not specified","version":"not specified"}],"descriptiveKeywords":[{"keywords":[{"value":"Environmental monitoring facilities"}],"type":"theme"},{"keywords":[{"value":"radioactive contamination"},{"value":"radionuclide"}],"type":"discipline"}],"boundingBoxes":[{"westBoundLongitude":-180,"eastBoundLongitude":180,"southBoundLatitude":-90,"northBoundLatitude":90}],"metadataPointsOfContact":[{"organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"pointOfContact","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire ","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"United Kingdom"}}],"distributorContacts":[{"organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"distributor","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk"}],"responsibleParties":[{"organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"pointOfContact","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire ","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"United Kingdom"}},{"organisationName":"Shore Section","role":"resourceProvider","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk"},{"organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"pointOfContact","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Lancaster Environment Centre,  Library Avenue, Bailrigg","city":"Lancaster","administrativeArea":"Lancashire","postalCode":"LA1 4AP","country":"United Kingdom"}},{"organisationName":"Natural Environment Research Council","role":"owner","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Polaris House, North Star Avenue","city":"Swindon","postalCode":"SN2 1EU","country":"UK"}}],"onlineResources":[{"url":"http://www.star-radioecology.org","name":"STAR website","description":"website","function":"information","type":"OTHER"},{"url":"https://gateway.ceh.ac.uk/","name":"CEH Information Gateway","description":"Information about data produced by STAR participants","function":"information","type":"OTHER"}],"children":[{"title":"Natural radionuclide concentrations in soil, water and sediments in England and Wales","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/bb2d7874-7bf4-44de-aa43-348bd684a2fe","associationType":"dataset"}],"datasetReferenceDate":{"creationDate":"2012-01-05"},"resourceMaintenance":[{"frequencyOfUpdate":"notPlanned"}],"resourceType":{"value":"series"},"datacitable":false,"dataciteMintable":false,"associatedResources":[{"title":"Natural radionuclide concentrations in soil, water and sediments in England and Wales","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/bb2d7874-7bf4-44de-aa43-348bd684a2fe","associationType":"dataset"}],"mapViewable":false}
