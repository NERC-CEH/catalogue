(P4GES)","description":"This is a collection of data from experiments and surveys carried out in the Ankeniheny Zahamena Forest Corridor - the remains of the evergreen forest of eastern Madagascar. \n\nThe data comprise land use /cover classification, biomass estimates, forest inventory, site description, topographic information, site location, soil profile, above and below-ground carbon stocks, vegetation and indicator vegetation species and wood specific gravity.\n\nIt was produced by work package 4 of the P4GES (Can Paying for Global Ecosystem Services reduce poverty) project - a three year project (2013 - 2016) involving a consortium of eleven institutions in the UK, Madagascar, the USA, Switzerland and the Netherlands.  The project focused on a single ecosystem (tropical forest) in a single low income country (Madagascar) to achieve a uniquely complete analysis in an effort to answer the central research question: \"How can international ecosystem service payment schemes (specifically for carbon sequestration/storage and biodiversity conservation) most effectively reduce poverty in low income countries, given biophysical, economic and political realities\"?\n\nThe project was funded by ESPA (Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation) - a research programme supported by DFID, NERC and ESRC and accredited by LWEC.","metadataDate":"2020-01-23T13:40:16","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/9461f9d7-f7a5-4328-a395-50a3b25da190"}],"lineage":"Please see individual data records for lineage information","alternateTitles":["Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme","P4GES"],"topicCategories":[{"value":"economy","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/economy"},{"value":"environment","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/environment"}],"descriptiveKeywords":[{"keywords":[{"value":"Can Paying for Global Ecosystem Services reduce poverty"},{"value":"Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation"},{"value":"tropical forest"},{"value":"Madagascar"},{"value":"Ankeniheny Zahamena Forest Corridor"},{"value":"CAZ"},{"value":"DFID"},{"value":"Department for International Development"},{"value":"NERC"},{"value":"Natural Environment Research Council"},{"value":"ESRC"},{"value":"Economic and Social Research Council"},{"value":"LWEC"},{"value":"Living with Environmental Change"}]}],"boundingBoxes":[{"westBoundLongitude":43.1914,"eastBoundLongitude":50.4838,"southBoundLatitude":-25.6089,"northBoundLatitude":-11.9454}],"responsibleParties":[{"organisationName":"Environmental Information Data Centre","role":"custodian","email":"info@eidc.ac.uk"}],"temporalExtents":[{"begin":"2013-01-01","end":"2016-12-31"}],"onlineResources":[{"url":"http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/images/browsegraphics/espa_logo.png","function":"browseGraphic","type":"OTHER"}],"supplemental":[{"name":"P4GES website","description":"The P4GES project aims to answer the question 'how can international ecosystem service payment schemes (specifically for carbon sequestration/storage and biodiversity conservation) most effectively reduce poverty in low income countries'.","url":"http://www.p4ges.org/","function":"website"},{"name":"ESPA website","description":"ESPA is a global interdisciplinary research programme that aims to give decision-makers and natural resource users the evidence they need to address the challenges of sustainable ecosystem management and poverty reduction.
