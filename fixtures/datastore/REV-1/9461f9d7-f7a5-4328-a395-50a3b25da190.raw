(P4GES)","description":"This is a collection of data from experiments and surveys carried out in the Ankeniheny Zahamena Forest Corridor - the remains of the evergreen forest of eastern Madagascar. \n\nThe data comprise land use /cover classification, biomass estimates, forest inventory, site description, topographic information, site location, soil profile, above and below-ground carbon stocks, vegetation and indicator vegetation species and wood specific gravity.\n\nIt was produced by work package 4 of the P4GES (Can Paying for Global Ecosystem Services reduce poverty) project - a three year project (2013 - 2016) involving a consortium of eleven institutions in the UK, Madagascar, the USA, Switzerland and the Netherlands.  The project focused on a single ecosystem (tropical forest) in a single low income country (Madagascar) to achieve a uniquely complete analysis in an effort to answer the central research question: \"How can international ecosystem service payment schemes (specifically for carbon sequestration/storage and biodiversity conservation) most effectively reduce poverty in low income countries, given biophysical, economic and political realities\"?\n\nThe project was funded by ESPA (Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation) - a research programme supported by DFID, NERC and ESRC and accredited by LWEC.","metadataDate":"2019-11-27T12:37:28","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/9461f9d7-f7a5-4328-a395-50a3b25da190"}],"lineage":"Please see individual data records for lineage information","parentIdentifier":"9e18a47d-d670-4fb0-95b0-86db6e957034","alternateTitles":["Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme","P4GES"],"topicCategories":[{"value":"economy","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/economy"},{"value":"environment","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/environment"}],"descriptiveKeywords":[{"keywords":[{"value":"Can Paying for Global Ecosystem Services reduce poverty"},{"value":"Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation"},{"value":"tropical forest"},{"value":"Madagascar"},{"value":"Ankeniheny Zahamena Forest Corridor"},{"value":"CAZ"},{"value":"DFID"},{"value":"Department for International Development"},{"value":"NERC"},{"value":"Natural Environment Research Council"},{"value":"ESRC"},{"value":"Economic and Social Research Council"},{"value":"LWEC"},{"value":"Living with Environmental Change"}]}],"boundingBoxes":[{"westBoundLongitude":43.1914,"eastBoundLongitude":50.4838,"southBoundLatitude":-25.6089,"northBoundLatitude":-11.9454}],"responsibleParties":[{"organisationName":"Environmental Information Data Centre","role":"custodian","email":"eidc@ceh.ac.uk"}],"temporalExtents":[{"begin":"2013-01-01","end":"2016-12-31"}],"onlineResources":[{"url":"http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/images/browsegraphics/espa_logo.png","function":"browseGraphic","type":"OTHER"}],"parent":{"title":"NERC Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) Programme datasets","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/9e18a47d-d670-4fb0-95b0-86db6e957034","associationType":"aggregate"},"children":[{"title":"Forest inventory, dendrometric tree characteristics and aboveground biomass data in Ankeniheny Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/cbeea40f-8e35-4875-8b49-815e04f0cbd9","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Soil profile and chemistry data in the Ankeniheny Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/c3884aa0-b083-469d-8a0d-fdbbb79aff05","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Very high resolution derived biomass estimates in the Corridor  Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/9b516d3e-ac72-4453-a6de-b29d2ba2ef4f","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Wood specific gravity for trees in Ankeniheny Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar v2","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/efa10c00-d43a-4c94-b2f9-0708755e7d80","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Very high resolution derived land cover/use classifications for the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/ce535cef-842e-4875-ad80-26760900cec0","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Site description and location of direct measured trees in the Ankeniheny Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/a242e145-21f6-4c3c-b8e4-adce70e50d85","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Topographical characteristics of sites in the Ankeniheny Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/5771191f-8c12-40bf-af62-2624876616de","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Braun-Blanquet percentage vegetation cover and indicator species data in Ankeniheny Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/b31330cc-743c-431e-95cd-68b316efed0b","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Belowground carbon stock data in the Ankeniheny Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/993c5778-e139-4171-a57f-7a0f396be4b8","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Annual Forest Loss at 15m resolution in the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar, 2006-2014","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/c63c543f-3e95-4c1c-8c69-12f942271813","associationType":"dataset"},{"title":"Conservation and development investments in the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar, 2007-2014","href":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/f969f92f-baa6-4621-bf27-ea29409f16d0","associationType":"dataset"}],"supplemental":[{"name":"P4GES website","description":"The P4GES project aims to answer the question 'how can international ecosystem service payment schemes (specifically for carbon sequestration/storage and biodiversity conservation) most effectively reduce poverty in low income countries'.","url":"http://www.p4ges.org/","function":"website"},{"name":"ESPA website","description":"ESPA is a global interdisciplinary research programme that aims to give decision-makers and natural resource users the evidence they need to address the challenges of sustainable ecosystem management and poverty reduction.
