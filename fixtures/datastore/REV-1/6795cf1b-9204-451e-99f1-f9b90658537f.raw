Includes measurements of: vegetation composition and structure, flower resources, pollinator (bumblebee and butterfly) abundance, soil nutrients, soil invertebrates, soil surface active invertebrates, canopy active invertebrates, winter bird abundance and small mammal activity.\nExperiment conducted on 6 arable farms in eastern England.\nProject ran from 2002 - 2006 (detail in lineage section).\nCombination of field survey methods used (detail in lineage section).\nData collected as part of a multi-site experiment to investigate the effectiveness of new agri-environment scheme options for conserving and enhancing a broad range of taxa and ecosystem functions. \nThe following hypotheses were tested:\nH1: Extensification of arable land management results in greater biodiversity, and a more efficient delivery of a wider range of ecosystem services. However, complete removal from crop production (i.e. protected wildlife areas) is a more practical and effective means of enhancing biodiversity and delivering these key functions and services;\nH2: Management prescriptions specifically targeted to the requirements of declining taxa are more effective than those designed to deliver a broader range of environmental benefits;\nH3: The positive effects of management prescriptions on different taxa are reproducible over a wide variety of locations and soil types, and these patterns persist or strengthen over time;\nH4: Soil biodiversity is positively correlated to increases in above-ground biodiversity, and has a potentially important impact on ecosystem function; and,\nH5: Sowing seed mixtures to create species-rich vegetation on land removed from\nproduction will result in the greatest increases in trophic complexity in above- and below ground\nfood webs.\nThe project was led and coordinated by CEH (the Pywell Section), in collaboration with the Wildlife Farming Company.
