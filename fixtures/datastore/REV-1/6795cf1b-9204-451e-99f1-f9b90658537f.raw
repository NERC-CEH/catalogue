Includes measurements of: vegetation composition and structure, flower resources, pollinator (bumblebee and butterfly) abundance, soil nutrients, soil invertebrates, soil surface active invertebrates, canopy active invertebrates, winter bird abundance and small mammal activity.\nExperiment conducted on 6 arable farms in eastern England.\nProject ran from 2002 - 2006 (detail in lineage section).\nCombination of field survey methods used (detail in lineage section).\nData collected as part of a multi-site experiment to investigate the effectiveness of new agri-environment scheme options for conserving and enhancing a broad range of taxa and ecosystem functions. \nThe following hypotheses were tested:\nH1: Extensification of arable land management results in greater biodiversity, and a more efficient delivery of a wider range of ecosystem services. However, complete removal from crop production (i.e. protected wildlife areas) is a more practical and effective means of enhancing biodiversity and delivering these key functions and services;\nH2: Management prescriptions specifically targeted to the requirements of declining taxa are more effective than those designed to deliver a broader range of environmental benefits;\nH3: The positive effects of management prescriptions on different taxa are reproducible over a wide variety of locations and soil types, and these patterns persist or strengthen over time;\nH4: Soil biodiversity is positively correlated to increases in above-ground biodiversity, and has a potentially important impact on ecosystem function; and,\nH5: Sowing seed mixtures to create species-rich vegetation on land removed from\nproduction will result in the greatest increases in trophic complexity in above- and below ground\nfood webs.\nThe project was led and coordinated by CEH (the Pywell Section), in collaboration with the Wildlife Farming Company.

The treatments varied in the degree of management intervention, from restricted inputs to the cereal crop to complete removal of land from production and either allowing natural regeneration of vegetation or sowing seed mixtures of tussocky grasses, pollen and nectar-rich forbs and seed-bearing crops for farmland birds.\nData types collected as follows: \na) fixed quadrats for vegetation survey annually in late June 2002-2006; \nb) bumblebee, butterfly and flower counts on field margin plots by monthly transect walks from May-September 2002-2006; \nc) soil invertebrates from soil cores in January 2006 (identified to phyla, order or sub-order level with the exception of Coleoptera which were identified to family level); \nd) soil nutrients from soil cores in January 2006 (analysed for total carbon content, Olsen extractable phosphorous (P), exchangeable potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and total nitrogen (N%) using standard methods); \ne) soil surface active invertebrates on field margin plots from pitfall traps late April and October 2002-2006;\nf) canopy active invertebrates on field margin plots using Vortis suction sampler and standard sweep net in July 2003-2006 (identified to species level where possible and functional groups for analysis);\ng) winter bird abundance on seed-bearing crop and equivalent crop area in the field centre from monthly counts December - March 2002-2006;\nh) small mammal activity by live-trapping using Longworth traps over a one week period at five\nsites in November/December 2004 and again in late May/early June 2005.","metadataStandardName":"NERC profile of ISO19115:2003","metadataStandardVersion":"1.0","spatialRepresentationTypes":["textTable"],"datasetLanguages":["eng"],"topicCategories":[{"value":"biota","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/biota"},{"value":"farming","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/farming"}],"distributionFormats":[{"name":"Microsoft Excel","version":"97-2003"}],"descriptiveKeywords":[{"keywords":[{"value":"Species distribution"}],"type":"theme"},{"keywords":[{"value":"biodiversity"},{"value":"agri-environment"}],"type":"discipline"},{"keywords":[{"value":"England"}],"type":"place"},{"keywords":[{"value":"monthly"},{"value":"annually"}],"type":"temporal"},{"keywords":[{"value":"bumblebees"},{"value":"butterflies"},{"value":"farmland birds"},{"value":"soil invertebrates"},{"value":"field margins"}],"type":"theme"}],"boundingBoxes":[{"westBoundLongitude":-3.2,"eastBoundLongitude":1.23,"southBoundLatitude":51.5,"northBoundLatitude":54.88}],"metadataPointsOfContact":[{"individualName":"Carvell, C.","organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"pointOfContact","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"UK"}}],"distributorContacts":[{"individualName":"Pywell, R.","organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"distributor","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"UK"}}],"responsibleParties":[{"individualName":"Pywell, R.","organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"pointOfContact","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"UK"}},{"organisationName":"Pywell Section","role":"resourceProvider","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire ","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"United Kingdom"}},{"organisationName":"Natural Environment Research Council","role":"owner","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"c/o CEH, Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"Oxfordshire"}},{"organisationName":"Wildlife Farming Company","role":"owner","email":"http://www.uptonestate.co.uk/index.php/wildlife-co"},{"organisationName":"Defra","role":"owner","email":"helpline@defra.gsi.gov.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Customer Contact Unit, Eastbury House, 30-34 Albert Embankment ","city":"London","postalCode":"SE1 7TL"}},{"organisationName":"Syngenta","role":"owner","email":"General.Enquiries@syngenta.com"},{"organisationName":"Unilever plc","role":"owner","email":"http://www.unilever.co.uk/resource/contact/contactus.aspx"}],"temporalExtents":[{"begin":"2002-04-01","end":"2006-10-01"}],"onlineResources":[{"url":"http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sci_programmes/BUZZProject.html","description":"Brief project outline: for detail and final reports please contact the authors","function":"information","type":"OTHER"}],"spatialReferenceSystems":[{"code":"27700","codeSpace":"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG","title":"OSGB 1936 / British National Grid"}],"datasetReferenceDate":{"publicationDate":"2007-03-31"},"resourceMaintenance":[{"frequencyOfUpdate":"notPlanned","note":"Data collection has been completed."}],"accessConstraints":[{"value":"Licence terms and conditions apply","code":"otherRestrictions"}],"resourceType":{"value":"series"},"datacitable":false,"dataciteMintable":false,"mapViewable":false}
