Contains Humic Ion Binding Model VII, a mechanistic model of ion binding to humic and fulvic acids. Also contains submodels for ion binding to mineral oxide surfaces, and for ion exchange on clays.\n\nCan be used for modelling of proton and metal mixture bioavailability and ecological impact, under the name WHAM-FTOX.\n\nFirst version published 1994, contained Humic Ion Binding Model V and no oxide submodel. Windows version (WHAM6) released 2002, contained Humic Ion Binding Model VI and oxide submodel. Updated 2011 to contain Humic Ion Binding Model VII (WHAM7).","metadataDate":"2019-10-29T15:30:06","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/b7567cab-2ecb-41ef-bac3-d37e71924ee2"}],"keywords":[{"value":"speciation"},{"value":"equilibrium"},{"value":"humic substances"}],"primaryPurpose":"WHAM is a model for computation of equilibrium chemical speciation in waters (including soil waters) and soil-water/sediment-water systems.
