The literature was used to extract likely values of MultiMOVE inputs under 3 AES options (bracken control, woodland expansion, low input grassland). These values were used to predict the plant species that would occur under the new environmental conditions.","metadataDate":"2018-09-25T09:28:09","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/f65cea59-ccac-4bb1-b3d4-0f305bc7c051"}],"keywords":[{"value":"Agri-environment scheme"},{"value":"Habitat suitability"}],"projectCode":"NEC04780","projectObjectives":"To predict potential impacts of the Glastir AES on species occurrence","projectCompletionDate":"2010-09-01","projectWebsite":"https://gmep.wales/","funderDetails":"Welsh Government (CEH project number NEC04780)","contactName":"Simon Smart","contactEmail":"ssma@ceh.ac.uk","multipleModelsUsed":"No","references":[{"citation":"Emmett, Bridget; Abdalla, Mohamed; Anthony, Steven; August, Tom; Barrett, Gaynor; Biggs, Jeremy; Botham, Marc; Bradley, David; Brown, Mike; Carter, Heather; Chadwick, David; Cigna, Francesca; Cooper, David; Cooper, Jonathan; Cosby, Jack; Creer, Simon; Cross, Paul; Edwards, Francois; Edwards, Michael; Evans, Christopher; Ewald, Naomi; Fitton, Andrew; Garbutt, Angus; Grebby, Stephen; Greene, Sheila; Halfpenney, Ian; Hall, Jane; Harrison, Samantha; Harrower, Colin; Henrys, Peter; Hobson, Russell; Hughes, Steven; Isaac, Nick; Jackson, Bethanna; Jarvis, Susan; Jones, Davey; Keith, Aidan; Kelly, Martin; Korenko, J.; Lallias, Delphine; Leaver, David; Lebron, Inma; Malcolm, Heath; Maskell, Lindsay; McDonald, J.; Moxley, Janet; Norton, Lisa; O'Hare, Matthew; Owen, Anthea; Dos Santos Pereira, Gloria; Peyton, Jodey; Powney, Gary; Pywell, Richard; Rawlins, Barry; Robinson, David; Rorke, Stephanie; Rowland, Clare; Roy, David; Scarlett, Peter; Scholefield, Paul; Scott, Andy; Scott, Louise; Scott, Rod; Siriwardena, Gavin; Smart, Simon; Smith, Peter; Swetnam, Ruth; Taylor, Rachel; Tordoff, George; Van Breda, John; Vincent, Helen; Wagner, Markus; Waters, Emma; Watkins, John; White, J.; Williams, Bronwen; Wood, Claire; Wright, Simon. 2014 Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme.
