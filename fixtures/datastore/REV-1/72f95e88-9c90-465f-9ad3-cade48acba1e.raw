It was moved to its present location in 2009. Samples consist of ground and unground wheat grain, straw, soil and herbage together with fertilisers, manures and lime from the Rothamsted Long-term Experiments (LTEs). In addition, several thousand soils collected from around the world in the 1920’s-50’s are stored in the archive together with samples from discontinued experiments. About 1200 crop & 200 soils samples are added annually.\n\nPlant samples are oven dried, but soil samples are air dried. The samples are stored in a variety of containers, each with a unique label and identification number. Each shelf has a unique identifier and sample locations are recorded in the archive database.\n\nInitially, samples were analysed for their nutrient content, including – N, C, P, K, Na, Mg etc, but with the development of new analytical techniques the samples have been used for many other studies, including:\n* Detecting changes in atmospheric S deposition over time.\n* The development of fungicide resistance in plant pathogens.\n* The effects of S deposition on plant pathogen populations.\n* Detecting fallout from atomic bomb tests in the 1950s.","metadataDate":"2019-08-05T11:31:29","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/72f95e88-9c90-465f-9ad3-cade48acba1e"}],"availability":"The use of samples and data for collaborative research is actively encouraged via contact with the Sample Archive manager and the e-RA data managers.
