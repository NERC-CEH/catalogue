This dataset creates a baseline for possible long-term, near real-time monitoring of encroachment and illegal logging within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor (CAZ), Madagascar. This analysis includes a summary of suspected encroachment and illegal logging from June 2006 to December 2010 within the \"protected area,\" which consists of zones such as priority for conservation, sustainable use, and controlled settlements.
