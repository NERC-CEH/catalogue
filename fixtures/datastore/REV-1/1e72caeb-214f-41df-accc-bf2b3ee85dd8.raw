It achieves this by monitoring the concentrations of contaminants of concern in bird carcasses and eggs. This provides information on the extent of risk to vertebrate wildlife (and potentially Man) and how this varies temporally and spatially. Such variation can result from market-led or regulatory changes in chemical use. It may also be associated with larger-scale phenomena, such as global environmental change, which can alter the environmental fate and behaviour of chemicals.
