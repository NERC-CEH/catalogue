Ecological information was recorded at the site level and in more detail from 16 200m2 sample plots located at random within each site. Data were collected on plant species composition in the canopy and ground flora, soil pH and Soil Organic Matter, habitat management and a wide range of other plot and site-level descriptors. All sites and, where possible, sample plots were revisited and recorded again over the growing seasons of 2000, 2002 and 2003 (referred to subsequently as the '2001 survey'), using exactly the same field methods.  Data were collected under projects managed by The Nature Conservancy (in 1971) and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (in 2001).  Users of the datasets belonging to this series should consult the supporting documentation for further information on field methods and analytical results.","metadataDate":"2015-04-16T11:14:35","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"1382103460880","codeSpace":"CEH:EIDC:","coupledResource":"CEH:EIDC:#1382103460880"}],"resourceStatus":"Current","lineage":"Data were collected on paper from 103 woodlands by field surveyors employed by The Nature Conservancy, Merlewood Research Station, Cumbria (in 1971) and employed under a project managed by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (in 2000-2003). Extensive training was undertaken by surveyors. Collected data were double punched into spreadsheets as a form of quality control before being compiled into a database.  Data collected are available as 4 separate datasets: flora data, soil data, tree diameter data and site details.","metadataStandardName":"NERC profile of ISO19115:2003","metadataStandardVersion":"1.0","datasetLanguages":["eng"],"topicCategories":[{"value":"biota","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/biota"},{"value":"environment","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/environment"}],"distributionFormats":[{"name":"Comma separated values","version":"2013"}],"descriptiveKeywords":[{"keywords":[{"value":"Environmental monitoring facilities"}],"type":"theme"},{"keywords":[{"value":"woodlands"},{"value":"pedosphere"}]},{"keywords":[{"value":"ecological survey"}],"type":"discipline"},{"keywords":[{"value":"Ecosystem services","uri":"http://onto.nerc.ac.uk/CEHMD/topic/6"}]}],"boundingBoxes":[{"westBoundLongitude":-8.648,"eastBoundLongitude":1.7675,"southBoundLatitude":49.863,"northBoundLatitude":60.860}],"metadataPointsOfContact":[{"organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"pointOfContact","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk"}],"distributorContacts":[{"organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"distributor","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk"}],"responsibleParties":[{"individualName":"Smart, S.M.","organisationName":"Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","role":"pointOfContact","email":"enquries@ceh.ac.uk"},{"organisationName":"Parr Section","role":"resourceProvider","email":"enquiries@ceh.ac.uk"},{"organisationName":"EIDC Hub","role":"custodian","email":"eidc@ceh.ac.uk"}],"temporalExtents":[{"begin":"1971-05-01","end":"2003-10-31"}],"onlineResources":[{"url":"http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ddff0f17-c95d-4415-80cb-aa9487edcb06/zip","name":"Supporting information","description":"Supporting information available for this series","function":"information","type":"OTHER"}],"spatialReferenceSystems":[{"code":"27700","codeSpace":"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG","title":"OSGB 1936 / British National Grid"}],"datasetReferenceDate":{"publicationDate":"2013-12-10"},"resourceMaintenance":[{"frequencyOfUpdate":"notPlanned"}],"accessConstraints":[{"value":"Licence terms and conditions apply","code":"license"}],"resourceType":{"value":"series"},"datacitable":false,"dataciteMintable":false,"mapViewable":false,"topics":["http://onto.nerc.ac.uk/CEHMD/topic/6"]}
