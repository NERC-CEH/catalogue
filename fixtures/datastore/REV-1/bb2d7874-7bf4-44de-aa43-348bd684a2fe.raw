Data comprise estimates of activity concentrations of 40K, 238U and 232Th series radionuclides in environmental media (soil, stream sediments and stream waters) derived from total K, U and Th concentrations mainly from the ongoing geochemical survey of the United Kingdom (G-BASE), conducted by the British Geological Survey. The geochemical survey data are currently incomplete for England and Wales, but almost complete coverage was obtained for K in stream sediments by using the Wolfson Atlas data for southern England. \nFor U and Th in sediments and K, U and Th in soils, more complete coverage was\nachieved by geological extrapolation (using relationships between soils/sediments\nand bedrock/superficial geology). For soils and sediments, datasets are provided\nfor both:(i) geometric mean concentrations from measured samples on a 5 x 5 km\nsquare basis where data are available; and (ii) extrapolated surfaces covering all of England and Wales.\nAn Information Gateway view service is available.
