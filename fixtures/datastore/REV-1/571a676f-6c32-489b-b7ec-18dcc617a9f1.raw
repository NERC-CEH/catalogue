The UKBMS comprises a suite of surveys carried out each year across the UK that generate data on butterfly abundance. \n\nThe UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) has operated since 1976 and involves thousands of volunteers collecting data every week throughout the summer. The scheme comprises three survey methods:\n\n1. Traditional butterfly transects (Pollard walks):Butterfly data is recorded from fixed-route walks (transects), typically about 2-4km long, established at a site and recorded on a regular (weekly) basis under reasonable weather conditions for a number of years from the beginning of April until the end of September. Most transects record all butterfly species, some focus on a single species and are just recorded during that species flight period.\n\n2. Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey squares:Butterflies are counted along fixed-route walks, within randomly selected 1km grid squares and recorded at least twice during July and August under reasonable weather conditions, although additional counts may be made during the spring and summer.\n\n3. Reduced effort methods:Alternative, more rapid approaches targeted at specific species and sites include ‘timed counts’ (recording the abundance of adults of a particular species over a set period of time and within a set area during suitable weather conditions) and egg and larval web counts (recording the number of eggs or larval webs of a species (e.g. Marsh Fritillary) from a given area of suitable habitat.\n\nUKBMS data is widely used for research; a list of publications as well as downloadable PDF copies of past Annual Reports is made available via the UKBMS website.\n\nDatasets currently available for download are yearly calculations of species trends and collated indices of abundance, as well as yearly updated site data. Access to other data should be requested directly via the UKBMS website.\n\nThe UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The UKBMS is indebted to all volunteers who contribute data to the scheme.","metadataDate":"2020-01-23T13:30:13","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/571a676f-6c32-489b-b7ec-18dcc617a9f1"}],"lineage":"Data collected by UKBMS volunteers is captured electronically and undergoes quality assurance. Following data collection, data is run through a series of analyses to provide annual indices of butterfly populations at UK and country level. During this process both Butterfly Conservation and CEH Wallingford validate the data through a series of manual and automated checks for quality assurance. Processed data is stored in an ORACLE database. A statistical model (Generalised Additive Model) is used to estimate an annual index of abundance at each site for each butterfly species. A further statistical model (Generalised Linear Model) is used to calculate national and regional population estimates (a collated index) for each species and is used to assess trends over time. National/regional indices of abundance for species are also combined to create composite indicators, published as Government indicators (e.g. http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4236). The transect data is also used to measure the phenology (timing of appearance) of each species, each year at each site. The results of the UKBMS are disseminated via an oral presentation at an annual National Recorder's Meeting typically held in March, in an Annual Report, typically published in December, and via the UKBMS website.","metadataStandardVersion":"1","datasetLanguages":["eng"],"securityConstraints":["unclassified"],"topicCategories":[{"value":"biota","uri":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/TopicCategory/biota"}],"keywordsOther":[{{"value":"CEH Biodiversity Programme"},{"value":"CEH Project NEC03578"},{"value":"Lepidoptera"},{"value":"butterflies"},{"value":"Butterfly Conservation"},{"value":"Joint Nature Conservation Committee"},{"value":"JNCC"},{"value":"Scottish Natural Heritage"},{"value":"SNH"},{"value":"Forestry Commission"},{"value":"Northern Ireland Environment Agency"},{"value":"Natural England"},{"value":"Natural Environment Research Council"},{"value":"NERC"},{"value":"Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs"},{"value":"Defra"},{"value":"Natural Resources Wales"},{"value":"NRW"},{"value":"Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru"},{"value":"UK","uri":"http://sws.geonames.org/2635167"},{"value":"England","uri":"http://sws.geonames.org/6269131"},{"value":"Scotland","uri":"http://sws.geonames.org/2638360"},{"value":"Wales","uri":"http://sws.geonames.org/2634895"},{"value":"Northern Ireland","uri":"http://sws.geonames.org/2641364"},{"value":"Natural Capital","uri":"http://onto.nerc.ac.uk/CEHMD/NC"},{"value":"Biodiversity","uri":"http://onto.nerc.ac.uk/CEHMD/topic/2"}}],"spatialResolutions":[{"distance":"1000","uom":"urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9001"}],"responsibleParties":[{"organisationName":"UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme","role":"pointOfContact","email":"ukbms@ceh.ac.uk","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Maclean Building, Benson Lane, Crowmarsh Gifford","city":"Wallingford","administrativeArea":"Oxfordshire","postalCode":"OX10 8BB","country":"UK"}},{"organisationName":"Butterfly Conservation","organisationIdentifier":"https://ror.org/05jg03a59","role":"pointOfContact","email":"info@butterfly-conservation.org","address":{"deliveryPoint":"Manor Yard, East Lulworth","city":"Wareham","administrativeArea":"Dorset","postalCode":"BH20 5QP","country":"UK"}}],"temporalExtents":[{"begin":"1976-04-01"}],"onlineResources":[{"url":"http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/images/browsegraphics/ukbms_LOGO.png","name":"UKBMS logo","function":"browseGraphic","type":"OTHER"}],"supplemental":[{"name":"UKBMS website","description":"This is a web page which provides data for each butterfly species at each monitored site.
