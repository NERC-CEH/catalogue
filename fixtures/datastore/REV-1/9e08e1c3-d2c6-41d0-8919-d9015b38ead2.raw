Ireland)","description":"This dataset consists of the 1km raster, percentage target class version of the Land Cover Map 2015 (LCM2015) for Northern Ireland. The 1km percentage product provides the percentage cover for each of 21 land cover classes for 1km x 1km pixels. This product contains one band per target habitat class (producing a 21 band image).  The 21 target classes are based on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Broad Habitats, which encompass the entire range of UK habitats.   This dataset is derived from the vector version of the Land Cover Map, which contains individual parcels of land cover and is the highest available spatial resolution. LCM2015 is a land cover map of the UK which was produced at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology by classifying satellite images from 2014 and 2015 into 21 Broad Habitat-based classes. It is the latest in a series of land cover maps, which began with Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) in 1990 (LCMGB is now often referred to as LCM1990), and was followed by Land Cover Maps for 2000 and 2007 (LCM2000 and LCM2007 respectively), both of which covered the entire UK. \n LCM2015 consists of a range of raster and vector products and users should familiarise themselves with the full range (see related records, the CEH web site and the LCM2015 Dataset documentation) to select the product most suited to their needs. \n\n","metadataDate":"2019-10-18T12:55:18","resourceIdentifiers":[{"code":"https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/9e08e1c3-d2c6-41d0-8919-d9015b38ead2"},{"code":"10.5285/9e08e1c3-d2c6-41d0-8919-d9015b38ead2","codeSpace":"doi:"}],"lineage":"The percentage target class is produced from the 25m raster product by:\n1.\tUsing gdal_calc to split the 21 target classes into 21 individual images for each class where the presence of the class in question is recorded as 100 and absence is assigned 0.\n2.\tGdal_warp is then applied to each of the 21 presence/absence images to resample to 1km, using the 'average' option under resample.
