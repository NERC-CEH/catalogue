    <h1>CEH Metadata Record with id ${id}</h1>
    <p>
      This is a freemarker template for a metadata record. You can read variables like this.
      <code> ${id} </code>

      The properties which are available to you can be found by looking at the GeminiDocument.java from
      the uk.ac.ceh.gateway.catalogue.gemini package.

      Be careful to check that the element you are going to read is present in the document. It is worth
      brushing up on the <a href="http://freemarker.org/docs/dgui.html">Template authors guide</a> before begining to write templates
