# Catalogue

This is the code base for the CEH gemini catalogue. The intention here is the make a code structure which is customisable for different catalogue types. EF/CEH/UKEOF

## Map of Code Base

- java. Inside here is the java code which powers the catalogue. Define the object model in here which represents the content of your catalogue

- templates. Here go the freemarker templates which your object model can use for things like generating HTML pages

- web. Any static or pre built content which can be hosted to help power your catalogue. (Javascripts/Images and the like)
