# Hello catalogue Developer, this is an example of the Hiera Secrets.yaml. This file
# will contain the configuration parameters of your catalogue deployment which can't
# (or should not) be committed back to the repository. e.g. passwords
#
# You will want to create a copy of this file and name it secrets.yaml. Customise
# this with the details which you would like to use. For example:
catalogue_config:
  'spring.profiles.active':   'production'
  'userstore.crowd.address':  'https://your.crowd.server'
  'userstore.crowd.username': 'INVALID'
  'userstore.crowd.password': 'INVALID'
