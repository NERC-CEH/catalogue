  <li>Provide a title that best describes that data resource. Include references to the subject, spatial and temporal aspects of the data resource.</li>

  <li>The leading letter and proper nouns of the title should be capitalised.</li>
  <li>If it's necessary to include acronyms in the formal title of a data resource, then include both the acronym (in parentheses) and its phrase or word from which it was formed.</li>
  <li>In the event that there are multiple titles, translations of titles (e.g. Welsh), and those with acronyms, these titles should be added as alternative titles</li>
